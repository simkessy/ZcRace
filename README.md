#  Lion King Race for the Crown 

Hi, This is a small application that displays racers and their results 

The UI is developed using Semantic UI 
There is not JS framework but the Babel Polyfill package was added to support ES6 features and ensure browser compatability. 

I'm working on a Ubuntu Machine so was not able to test in IE 

To run the application just clone the repository and and open the index.html file
